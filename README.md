# timestamptranslator

## Meet a free, open-source browser extension that simplifies timestamp translation on web pages.
This handy tool automatically detects and converts Unix timestamps—whether in 11-digit (seconds) or 13-digit (milliseconds) format—making it a snap to understand dates and times online.
## Why I Built This Tool
During fast-paced development, I often queried databases to verify results. Constantly writing SQL queries to convert timestamps was a tedious, time-consuming chore. To make life easier, I created this extension to automate timestamp translation, speeding up debugging and data analysis.
## Key Features
1.  Works with both 11-digit (seconds) and 13-digit (milliseconds) Unix timestamps  

2.  Converts times to your local time zone automatically, supporting all IANA time zones  

3.  Lets you customize date and time formats to match your preferences

## Feedback & Support
Run into an issue or have an idea for a new feature? Feel free to contact. I’d also love contributions to improve localization or add new timestamp formats!
